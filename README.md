# fastFlix-backend

This repository hosts the back-end logic for fastFlix, a full-stack web application that allows users to browse popular racing films, make an account, and curate a personal list of their favorites.

There are two front-end clients that source data from this REST API, built with [React](https://github.com/AaronRDurant/fastFlix-React-client) and [Angular](https://github.com/AaronRDurant/fastFlix-Angular-client).
